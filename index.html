  CS 7976: Seminar in Technical Writing
</h1>
<h2 class="center">
  Fall 2019
</h2>
<div id="maincontent">

<p class="verticalspace"> The goal of this seminar is to help advanced
PhD students with writing and editing technical documents, such as
papers and dissertations.  We will cover basics of good English
composition, organization of sentences, paragraphs, and sections, and
other topics.  The exact topics and emphases will depend on the
students' needs.  </p>

<p>Enrollment is limited to 10 students, first come first served.  It
is <em>not</em> restricted to students from the PL group.  The course
is 2 credits, and does not count toward any specialty area.</p>

<p>Students should be working on papers or dissertations that we can
discuss and analyze. If you enroll in this course, you should send
me a short paper that you have written (5-10 pages is preferred), so
that I can begin to tailor the course to your needs.  </p>

<p>We will have a group meeting approximately weekly, and students will
have 1-on-1 sessions with the instructor as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Meeting Time</h2>

Our scheduled meeting time is

<p><strong>Wednesdays, 2:50-4:30, RY 145</strong>
</p>

<p>Our CRN is 16320
</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

We will set up a communications forum.   That might be via Piazza,
Gchat, or Slack-- we can decide that as a group at our first meeting.
