<p class="verticalspace">
The goal of this seminar is to help advanced PhD students with writing
and editing technical documents, such as papers and dissertations.  We
will cover basics of good English composition, organization of
sentences, paragraphs, and sections, and other topics.  Our initial
plan is to follow Norman Ramsey's course on <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/pubs/learn.pdf" >Technical Writing Using
the Engineering Method</a>, but the exact topics and emphases will depend
on the students' needs.
</p>

<p>Enrollment is limited to 10 students, first come first served.
It is <em>not</em> restricted to students from the PL group.  <strike>It is my
understanding that you can enroll in the course for either 2 credits
or 4 credits.  You will be expected to do the same work either way.
You should consult with your advisor and/or Prof. Rajaraman to decide
whether to enroll for 2 credits or for 4.</strike>  The course is 2
credits, and does not count toward any specialty area.</p>

<p>Students should be working on papers or dissertations that we can
discuss and analyze. If you enroll in this course, you should send
me a short paper that you have written (5-10 pages is preferred), so
that I can begin to tailor the course to your needs.  </p>

<p>We will have a group meeting approximately weekly, and students will
have 1-on-1 sessions with the instructor as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Meeting Time</h2>

Our scheduled meeting time is

<p><strong>Wednesdays, 2:50-4:30, SL 045</strong>
</p>

<p>Our CRN is 18122.
</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

We will set up a communications forum.   That might be via Piazza,
Gchat, or Slack-- we can decide that as a group at our first meeting.
