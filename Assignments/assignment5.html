    <p>

<hr>

<p>For this assignment, I'd like you to reflect on what you've learned
this semester.</p>

<p>Please write a paragraph or two describing <em>specific</em> things
that you learned this semester.  Be specific: don't say "I learned to
improve my writing."</p>

<p>Then write a paragraph describing specific things you wanted to
learn in this course but didn't.  These may be things we talked about
but that left you confused, or things that we didn't cover.</p>

<p>This exercise will help you crystallize your learning this semester
and will also help me learn the ways in which the course worked and
the ways it might be improved.</p>

<p>Turn in this assignment by email.</p>
