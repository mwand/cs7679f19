 Please submit an abstract of your research (a specific project) by
 Monday evening Oct. 14 to Slack.  It should be about 150-200 words
 and written as though for a scientific paper. You can write one for
 this assignment, or use/modify one you have already written.  We will
 do some analysis and reviewing of them in the next two classes.
