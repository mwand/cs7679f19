# Original

The equivalence under (a given) prefix is a symmetric operation. In
other words, it captures reversible transformations. Irreversible
transformations are captured by an instance relation ⊑. Moreover, we
distinguish a subrelation ⋿ − of ⊑ called _abstraction_. Inverse of
abstractions are sound relations for 3 but made explicit so as to
preserve type inference, while inverse of instance relations would, in
general, be unsound for ≼.

# My version

Equivalence under (a given) prefix is a symmetric operation and,
therefore, captures reversible transformations. We consider several
important irreversible transformations in the next section.

1.3. The abstraction relation

Instance relation ⊑ captures irreversible transformations between
types. For the purpose of type inference, it proves useful to consider
a subrelation ⋿ of ⊑ called _abstraction_. The importance of
abstraction comes from the fact that its inverse is a sound relation
for ≼ and, therefore, preserves type inference. In contrast, the
inverse of full instance relation would, in general, be unsound for ≼.
