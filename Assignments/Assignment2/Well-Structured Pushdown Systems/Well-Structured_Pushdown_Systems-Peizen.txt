1. Original Version

Combining PDSs and VASs is not new. Process rewrite system (PRS) [17]
is a pioneer work on such combination. A PRS is a(n AC) ground term
rewriting system, consisting of the sequential composition ".", the
parallel composition "|| ", and finitely many constants, which can
be regarded as a PDS with finite control states and vector stack
alphabet. The decidability of the reachability between ground terms
was shown based on the reachability of a VAS. However, a PRS is
rather weak to model multi-thread programs, since it cannot describe
vector additions between adjacent stack frames during push/pop operations.

2. Revised Version

Combining PDSs and VASs is not new. Process rewrite system (PRS) [17]
is a pioneer work on such a combination. Particularly, a PRS consists
of a sequential composition, a parallel composition, and finitely
many constants. We can regard it as a PDS with finite control states
and finite vector stack alphabet. The reachability of a PRS is
decidable [17]. A limitation is that PRS can not express vector
additions between two adjacent stack frames in the push/pop operations.
Therefore, different from our model WSPDS, PRS is too weak to model
multi-thread programs.
======================================================================

Combining PDSs and VASs is not new.  For example, a process rewrite
system (PRS) is a PDS with finite control states and a finite vector
stack alphabet. Reachability for these systems is still decidable, but
PRSs are too weak to model multi-thread programs.
