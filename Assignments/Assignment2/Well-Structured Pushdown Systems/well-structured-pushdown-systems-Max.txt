Combining PDSs and VASs is not new. Process rewrite system (PRS) [17]
is a pioneer work on such combination. A PRS is a(n AC) ground term
rewriting system, consisting of the sequential composition “.”, the
parallel composition “|| ”, and finitely many constants, which can be
regarded as a PDS with finite control states and vector stack
alphabet. The decidability of the reachability between ground terms
was shown based on the reachability of a VAS. However, a PRS is rather
weak to model multi-thread programs, since it cannot describe vector
additions between adjacent stack frames during push/pop operations.

# Rewritten

Some combinations of the features of PDSs and VASs have been studied
previously. In particular, Process rewrite systems (PRS) are one of
the first and best-known combinations. Compared to our notion of
WSPDS, PRSs are a rather weak model of multi-threaded programs. For
instance, PDSs cannot model vector additions between adjacent stack
frames during push or pop operations. Because they are relatively
weak, decidability of reachability for PDSs is reducable to that of
VASs, whereas we need a new proof altogether for WSPDs.
