Eye-Tracking Analysis of User Behavior in WWW Search

\subsection{Original text:}

How do users interact with the list of ranked results of WWW search
engines?  Do they read the abstracts sequentially from top to bottom,
or do they skip links?  How many of the results do users evaluate
before clicking on a link or reformulating the search?  The answers to
these questions will be beneficial in at least three ways.  First,
they provide the basis for improved interfaces.  Second, they suggest
more targeted metrics for evaluating the retrieval performance in WWW
search.  \textbf{And third, they help interpreting implicit feedback
like clickthrough and reading times for machine learning of improved
retrieval functions [2].  In particular, better understanding of user
behavior will allow us to draw more accurate inferences about how
implicit feedback relates to relative relevance judgments.}

\subsection{Updated version of bold text:}

And lastly, the data collected on implicit feedback such as
clickthrough and reading times can be fed into machine learning
algorithms to help discover better retrieval functions.  Specifically,
given a better understanding of how the users perform searches, we
could come up with better conclusions about how implicit feedback is
related to the relevance judgments of the users.
