<hr>

<p>For this assignment, I'd like you to rewrite and repurpose a
presentation.</p>

<p>Peizun has kindly agreed to share the presentation from his
proposal defense with the class.  The materials can be found <a
href="./Assignment4/Peizun/" >here</a>. </p>

<p>I'd like you to revise this presentation.</p>

<p>For this assignment, please work in groups.  Let me know who is in
each group by making a post on the class Slack, in #general.</p>

<p>Please form yourselves into 3 groups.    Each team should
repurpose the talk for one of the following situations:</p>

<ol>
  <li> a 45-minute proposal defense</li>
  <li> a 25-minute conference presentation (for PLDI?)</li>
  <li> a 45-minute hiring talk</li>
</ol>

<p>Each group should rewrite the presentation, using whatever tools
you prefer.  </p>

<p>Please organize yourselves so that all 3 alternatives are
covered.</p>

<p>Please use the guidelines I've collected <a href="../Materials/Slide-guidelines.html"
>here</a> as much as you can.</p>

<p>Feel free to change the title of the paper if you like.</p>

<p>In preparing your new version, please keep in mind the questions in
the "Pre-talk checklist" in the guidelines page, and be prepared to
discuss your decisions in class.</p>


<p>Feel free to change the title of the paper if you like.</p>

<p>Peizun's materials include the figures.   Some are in pdf, others
are tex diagrams, but you should be able to screenshot them into
usable form.  (Just running Peizun/src/slides/slides.tex in TexLive
worked for me.)  If you want to modify, rather than simply re-use, a
figure, feel free to do so, but don't spend too much time on details
of the graphics.</p>


<p>Turn in the assignment by having one of the members of the group
email me the presentation.  For right now, I'm only asking for the
final presentation, not the source materials, but I may change my mind
about that.</p>
