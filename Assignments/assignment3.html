<h1>CS 7976: Assignment 3: Editing and Cutting a Paper</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Out:</strong> Wednesday, October 10, 2018
      <br />
      <strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 15, 2018

<hr>

<p>Today in class, we saw a paper that needed some serious rewriting
and shortening.</p>

<p>For next week, I'd like you to edit and shorten the paper.   Your
edited version should be approximately 50-60% of the original.
Please revise the abstract as well, if needed.
</p>

<p>In preparing your new version, please keep in mind the following
points, and be prepared to discuss your decisions in class.</p>

<ul>

  <li>What is the main point of the paper?</li>

  <li>How should the paper be divided into sections?  What is the
  purpose of each section.</li>

  <li>What is the purpose of each paragraph in its section?</li>

  <li>In each paragraph, how are the sentences sequenced?</li>

</ul>

<p>Feel free to change the title of the paper if you like.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the figures.  If you think a figure is ok as is,
please say so.   If you think it doesn't add anything, just delete
it.  If there is some other figure that might work better, tell us
what it might be.</p>

<p>For this assignment, please work in groups.  Let me know who is in
each group by making a post on the class Slack, in #general.</p>

<p>Turn in the assignment by having one of the members of the group
email me a text file.</p>
