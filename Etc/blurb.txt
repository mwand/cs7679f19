CS 7976 (Section 01) CRN 16320
Directed Study: Seminar in Technical Writing for Computer Science
2 credits, Fall 2019, Professor Wand
limited to 10 students.

The goal of this seminar is to help advanced PhD students with writing
and editing technical documents, such as papers and dissertations.  We
will cover basics of good English composition, organization of
sentences, paragraphs, and sections, and other topics.  We also
consider the organization of effective papers and other scientific
documents.  The exact topics and emphases will depend on the students'
needs.

Students should be working on papers or dissertations that we can
discuss and analyze. If you enroll in this course, you should send me
a short paper that you have written (5-10 pages is preferred), so that
I can begin to tailor the course to your needs.  Enrollment is limited
to 10 students, first come first served.  It is _not_ restricted to
students from the PL group.  The course is 2 credits, and does not
count toward any specialty area.

We will have a group meeting approximately weekly, and students will
have 1-on-1 sessions with the instructor as appropriate.
